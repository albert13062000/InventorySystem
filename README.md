The scope of the project is to develop an inventory management system with shop rite as the case study.
The major tool I used to implement this work is visual studio. I used this IDE to generate the interface and also write the C# codes. According to the project, the principal users are the administrator and the user. Some fields added to the GUI displaying the form include input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc. 

I. User Interface
I created a C# application with a graphical user interface (GUI) based on the displays of an Inventory Management System given in the interaction. I wrote code to display each of the following forms in the GUI:
A. Welcome from: I created a welcome form that basically displays the welcome screen when either the administrator or the user opens it.

B. The login form: This is a form that contains fields where the user is supposed to key in his/her username and password.

C. The main form: This form shows controls such as buttons for “Add,” “Modify,” “Delete,” “Search” for parts and products, and “Exit”. Text boxes for searching for parts and products are also provided. It is important to state that there are two different main forms. One for the administrator and the other for the attendant. On the administrator form, there are five main buttons that can be clicked to issue certain commands. They are products, categories, customers, users, and orders. The user form also contains all these except users.

D. Product Form: This form entails a list of products that have already been inputted in the database and ones yet to be added. The form gives the flexibility to rename a product if a mistake has been made or delete an entire product category if it’s redundant.  

E. Categories from This form allows the administrator to add and delete some categories of products from the catalog. On the attendant side, he or she can add or delete product categories based on preference.

F. Customer form: This form allows the administrator to input the name of the perform who’s purchasing the item. The administrator can also perform editing functions on the name. The customer can also do the same when he or she visits the shop. 

G. Users form: The form is only limited to the administrator view. The administrator can see the number of people who are logged into the system.

H. Order Form: The order form is accessible to both the administrator and the user. Orders made can be viewed from both the user and administer end except that the user can only see his or her order while the administrator can see all orders made by all the users.
